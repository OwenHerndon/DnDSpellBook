# DnDSpellBook

An application that takes the spellbook featured in the back of 5th edition players handbook and allows user to easily navigate by class to reduce the amount of page turning.

Another feature will allow users to add a character or multiple character to their pages and then attach spells that each character has to them.

Spells can be found by a search input that will ping a DnD5e API or adding your own to the database via a forum and post method.
